# Week 13: Crafting a Proposal for an UX LLM Focused on User Research# 
## Week of 11/7/2024 - 11/14/2024

This week, I devoted significant time to developing a proposal for creating a UX Language Model (LLM) centered on enhancing user research processes. 

In writing the proposal, I enhanced my skills in articulating complex ideas clearly and persuasively. I had to balance technical feasibility with creative vision, which challenged me to think critically and innovatively. I also gained deeper insights into the ethical considerations essential to developing AI tools, especially concerning user data privacy and representation accuracy.

Looking forward, I speculate that refining this UX LLM could revolutionize user research by significantly reducing the time and resources required for comprehensive analysis and understanding of user needs. If implemented, it could democratize access to advanced UX insights, allowing even small teams to leverage sophisticated tools. This could lead to more user-centric product designs, fostering innovation across industries. As I continue to refine this proposal, I plan to explore partnerships with organizations in the UX field to validate and potentially pilot the concepts laid out in my proposal. This project marks an exciting step in merging technology with user experience to drive more intuitive and effective designs.

# Week 12: TDF Hiatus# 
## Week of 11/7/2024 - 11/14/2024

During the week of November 7-14, 2024, I found myself with a brief academic pause as our Technology Design Foundations class did not meet due to the observance of Veterans Day. Seizing this opportunity, I dedicated significant time to advancing the Project 3 report. Diving deep into the research phase, I focused on consolidating the findings and insights gathered from our project development. This involved meticulously analyzing our design process, outcomes, and the feedback received during previous presentations. It was a productive week that allowed me to refine the report's structure and ensure that each section comprehensively articulates our journey and solutions.

In parallel, I allocated time to work on the weekly report, ensuring I stayed on top of documenting my ongoing learning experiences and project progress. This report is crucial as it not only provides a timeline of my activities but also encourages reflection on how each task contributes to my overarching educational goals. I took this weekly update as an opportunity to intricately link my learnings from the Project 3 work with broader design principles, helping me reinforce my understanding of the subject matter. This dedicated time for reflection and documentation has been invaluable, allowing me to align my efforts with both immediate project goals and long-term career aspirations.

# Week 11: Advancing with ZeroWidth LLMs# 
## Week of 10/31/2024 - 11/7/2024

During this week, I delved deeper into utilizing ZeroWidth to develop different language models. Building on my prior exploration of the ZeroWidth Sandbox, I dedicated this week to grasp a more comprehensive understanding of the platform's capabilities and nuances. Engaging with more advanced features, I undertook the task of creating multiple distinct language models, each designed for a specific purpose, leveraging the unique functionalities offered by ZeroWidth.<br/>

The highlight of the week was experimenting with the customization options available for language models within ZeroWidth. I explored how various parameters influenced the output and behavior of the models, thereby gaining insights into fine-tuning techniques essential for optimizing performance. An important takeaway was understanding the significance of training data diversity. The models' ability to generalize and provide coherent responses was heavily reliant on the variety and richness of the data inputted into them.<br/>

However, the most fascinating aspect lay in developing an LLM inspired by my father. Attempting to digitize his counsel and supportive tone opened up considerations around the emotive qualities of language that purely technical efforts may overlook. The technical steps‚Äîfeeding his previous emails and communication samples to the LLM‚Äîwere straightforward. Yet, the challenge was preserving his distinct warmth, wisdom, and sometimes subtly humorous undertones, which seemed to be a testament to the intricacies of human language.<br/>

<p align= "center"> <img width="500"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a461cae-fa86-4553-9a64-a2ffbf4b4872"> <br/> <img width="500"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7ef765a-7926-4b6d-8f89-a748feaefa9b"><img width="500"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/92e58bb7-8dfb-4d0d-9923-17d05865b812"><br/> </p>


Reflecting on my learnings, I realized the significant potential of ZeroWidth as a transformative tool in educational and creative writing fields. By allowing users to input personalized writing styles and vocabulary, ZeroWidth can democratize access to writing assistance, enabling individuals to refine their writing skills through AI collaboration effectively. However, I am also cognizant of the ethical considerations this presents, particularly in preserving the reflective aspect of writing as a learning process.<br/>

Looking towards the future, I speculate that ZeroWidth and similar platforms will evolve to become more intuitive, with user-friendly interfaces that cater to non-experts in AI, broadening the accessibility and utility of LLMs across industries. The technology's potential to revolutionize content creation and personalized education is immense, with AI facilitating even deeper personalization, such as custom-tailored educational materials for individual learning styles. However, I foresee the need for ongoing discourse and regulation around data privacy and bias, ensuring that as these tools advance, they do so equitably and ethically.<br/>

Moreover, while experimenting with gender assumptions and pronoun misinterpretations observed in previous trials, I focused on strategies to mitigate these issues. This involved integrating more representative and inclusive datasets, thereby enhancing the models' ability to accurately identify and respond to different identities. Implementing these changes provided a clearer view of how bias can be systematically reduced in AI systems, a reflection of the critical role design can play in advancing ethical AI usage.<br/>

Overall, this week was pivotal in demystifying the underlying architecture of language models within ZeroWidth. I improved my skill set regarding the technical intricacies of model training and adjustment, alongside acknowledging the ethical implications that accompany the development of AI-driven language solutions. Moving forward, I aim to further explore collaborative integration with other tools and refine these models to be more robust, flexible, and ethically considerate.<br/>


# Week 10: Experimenting with ZeroWidth#
## Week of 10/24/2024

This week, I followed the tutorials created by the teaching team to have a better understanding of the ZeroWidth Sandbox. I was able to complete 3 out of the 4 tutorials, as I ran out of time and had to finish up other assignments. It was quite interesting to use the sandbox, and I had fun creating a LLM using a "knowledge" base sourced from the essaies I wrote for UC Berkeley for the MDes Program. I think that there is some fine tuning that would be required of it, but I am excited to see how I can play around with it for this project.<br/>

<p align= "center"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0221d039-99cd-48d7-95a2-79484af494a9"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bc395792-f3ef-492e-87f1-75e66d880325"><br/> </p>

For some reason, I kept running into an error when using the "test agent flow" function, and would have to publish my flow and refresh the page to have it work and respond to me. As well, I thought it was interesting that when asked about "Hanna Khoury" the bot automatically assumed that I was a man, and used He/Him pronouns to describe me. That is a possiblie issue in the OpenAI GPT 4.0 LLM. When I input the text "knowledge base" of my essaies, and used She/Her pronouns to describe myself, the bot was able to gender me correctly. <br/>

<p align= "center"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1b5056a-ca39-456a-a7dd-fcde0d54653d"> <br/> </p>

I speculate that this will be the future for essay writing. If I were to input every essay I had ever written into an LLM and taught it to use my prose, then I would not have to write as many essaies in the future. This could be dangerous because part of the learning of writing essaies is to reflect and think about your knowledge, and be able to challenge yourself to communicate your thoughts effectivley to the reader. 


# Week 9: Finalizing the Productivity Plant #
## Week of 10/24/2024

This week I my team and I finalized the work on our Productivity Plant project. We continued to work on it over the weekend, as we had to do some debugging on our code, as the placement of certain functions within our "loop" was causing our Plant to either not move, or move when it should not have. Eventually we figured out where the functions needed to be placed, and were able to get the photons to communicate with one another, and have all our outputs react as we intended them to. The next steps were to calibrate our inputs, specifically the loudness sensor and the accelerometer, to be able to properly detect when our user was moving or talking. I also helped coach Roopa to solder our button to longer lead wires, so that we could have longer reach on our circuit.<br/>

<p align= "center"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad5a7c7-8bdd-448b-9e18-06b79185b2ab"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/49b92a2f-34be-4d3e-9a9e-7b206d938f35"><br/> </p>

# Week 7: Continuing work on project 2 #
## Week of 10/17/2024

This week I my team and I continued to work on out project, the Productivity Plant. We created a sketch to understand how our wearable and the plant itself will be set up.<br/>
<p align= "center"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c654ec2e-a108-4f37-bd35-ac7227b88491"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/885518bc-e63e-420a-b851-f822371fa081"><br/> </p>


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e9cefc4f-70d3-4564-ae82-7242076e0086 <br/>


We started to work on testing out our different inputs and outputs, fabricate, and set up the code architechture. As the programming lead, I started to work on the coding architecture, and assisted Roopa with the code as she was setting up the hardware. As well, as the fabrication and circuitry consultant, I assisted Sylvie with becoming more comfortable with Fusion 360, and assisted Roopa with ensuring she was wiring up the circuits correctly. 
<p align= "center"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f6ea98e4-1dfb-4622-a54e-a258c24f5784)"><br/></p>
I speculate that during this upcomming weekend, my team will meet up again to continue our work, and as well, a lot more responsibility will lay on me as the fabrication and hardware components become finalized, and the programming will have to start to come together. 


# Week 6: Starting work on project 2 #
## Week of 10/10/2024

This week I was out of town over the weekend, and therefore became behind with some of the tutorials. I soldered my stemma. 
We made groups for project 2, I joined Sylvie and Roopa in a group, and we are creating an assistive digital and physical ecosystem that will help promote efficiency and productivity. 
We also created a little flyer describing what our project is. <br/>
<p align= "center"> <img width="300"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a1a4152-3cb5-4f73-8347-6fa3f4c74295)"><br/></p>
I speculate moving forward on this project, our self assigned roles will push us to develop new skills, and as each of us is a consultant for another role, we will heavily lean on one another for assistance. 

# Week 5: Running thourgh the Photon Tutorial #
## Week of 10/03/2024

This week, I went through three of the Photon tutorials that were required of us, as well as the three "introductory" code. I also wanted to challenge myself, and wrote a blink code from scratch, and flashed it to my photon, to have the on board LED blink, and have the serial monitor print when the LED was on and when it was off. <br/>
<p align= "center"> <img width="590"  src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f27ab0c7-7761-4b2c-9547-4eecc1ae52db"> <br/></p>
 
I did the button -> pulse rate, FSR->LED color, and Publish/Subscibe introduction tutorials. I found the first two tutorials to be straightforward, as I have coding and circuitry experience prior to this class. For the Publish/Subscribe tutorial, I worked alongside Roopa and used her photon as the additional device. <br/>
For the button-> pulse rate tutorial, i found it pretty easy. It did require me to change the circuit compared to the tutorial, as the tutorial requested we use a four legged button, and we were only provided with two legged buttons. To achieve the tutorial, I put the resistor in series with the button, and managed to have the same outcome. <br/>

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/38f87b40-5109-4f4f-b34a-82566af19cce <br/>

For the FSR -> LED color tutorial, I also had no difficulties, except with the pressure sensor itself. I found it to be not very sensitive, and had challenges with it sensing when I was pressing it. <br/>

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d4be4a8-3ec7-454e-a1a6-3b6205454dea <br/>

For the last tutorial, I did the Publish/Subscribe introduction tutorial. This tutorial proved to be the most challenging, as the code that was in the downloadable file for "subscribe" was not the same as was published on the tutorial page. The code on the tutorial page worked, though I had to not replace the "publish" code in entirety, and kept components of it. I worked with Roopa, and we exchanged turns with which photon would "publish" and which would "subscribe". 
<p align="center"> <img width="300" src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5288af95-ae7d-492f-a833-fc064354a27c> <img width="300" src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c8eba860-6802-4e91-b9dd-07155d85b9fd>  <img width="300" src=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dfe098e9-802f-483f-a8ba-e5fa997a9514> <br/> </p>

Overall, I found the tutorials easy. Reflecting on the differences between the code of these tutorials, in comparison to the tutorials taht we explored in class on monday, these have a lot more "constants" to identify the pins. As well, these tutorials contain functions. I have a basic understanding of functions, and am looking forward to exploring them more, and becoming more comfortable with coding architecture. In the future, it will be interesting to see how these funtions can be used in combinations to develop a more complex physical system. 


# Week 4: Analyzing my Device Ecosystem #
## Week of 09/26/2024

This week, in preparation for the second project, and for the homework, I brainstormed what devices and platforms I used on a regular basis, and due to the fact that I do not support the over complication of household processes and am careful to have to omuch of my data recorded, the only ecosystem that collects my data on a daily basis (that I am aware of and consent to) is my health and fitness tracking ecosystem. I created a concept maps of the different technologies and platforms that I use to collect and analyze my health and fitness data. <br/>
 <p align="center"> <img width="300" alt="Mapping Interaction Ecosystem" src="assets/Mapping Interaction ecosystem.jpg"></p><br/> 
 Going in to the future, corporations will attempt to collect even more of users' personal data, for botht their own internal analysis to track the usage of their products to be able to make better products, as well as continuing to sell our data for additional profit. I think there is a serious conversation that we as designers using emerging technology need to have regarding the collection, storage, and usage of consumer data. As well as users, we need to discuss "Is convenience worth having our data being sold without our consent?" 

# Week 3: Working on Project 1 #
## Week of 09/09/2024

This week, I continued to work on my computational design project. I started by creating a customizable tear drop shape, then moved into creating a shape more similarly to a wing. I first started with ideation and sketches
<p align="center"> <img width="300" alt="Ideation" src="assets/ideation.jpg"><br/> 
 <p align="center"> <img width="300" alt="Ideation" src="assets/Necklace sketch.jpg"><br/> </p>
 Then I started making some experiments.
 <p align="center"> <img width="300" alt="teardrop" src="assets/teardrop.png"><br/> 
 <p align="center"> <img width="450" alt="basic wing" src="assets/basic wing.png"><br/> </p>
  After sitting in for some of Cody's office hours in the makerspace, I decided to have both wings be placed in the grasshopper file, as well as all the additional componant, and have them set up so that the user can laser cut their pieces. <br/> 
 <p align="center"> <img width="700" alt="teardrop" src="assets/bowl of spagetti.png"><br/> 
Having worked on this project very intensly the past week, I am quite proud of the progress that I made in a software that I had never used prior to this class. I hope i will be able to continue to develop my experience in Rhino and Grasshopper, and find more uses that are more applicable to my envisioned career path. 

# Week 2: Becoming Better Aquainted with Grasshopper #
## Week of 09/19/2024

Over the weekend I tried to continue to go over the grasshopper tutorials, and was struggling a bit to understand how to read the files and create my own. I was able to play around with the sliders though, and that did help me understand a bit about how Grasshopper functioned (Images 2 and 3). <br/>

<p align="center"> <img width="300" alt="Experimenting with Example Files" src="assets/Phone stand 1.png"> <img width="300" alt="Experimenting with Example Files" src="assets/Phone stand 2.png"></p> <br/> 

During the class on Monday though, I attened the Grasshopper workshop, and understood a lot more of the structure, and the software really clicked with me. Looking to the future, I know that I tend to learn better from in-person workshops and tutorials, so I will strive to attend any office hours and workshops that are available to me.   <br/>

 <p align="center"><img width="300" alt="Experimenting in the Workshop" src="assets/Workshop Experiment.png"></p><br/>

After the workshop, I wanted to play around myself with creating shapes, and merging bodies together to create more complex shapes. Coming from a mechanical engineering background, where I am used to using SolidWorks, it has been a bit challenging to switch my thinking process around CAD from Solidworks to Rhino/Grasshopper. I wanted to test out creating an adjustable cloud shape. <br/>

 <p align="center"> <img width="400" alt="Experimenting in the Workshop" src="assets/Merge Testing.png"></p><br/>

I made this shape so that the radii of the cloud shperes could be changed, and therefore their placement relative to each other. However, while trying to create a shortcut to make a cloud shape, I accidentally created a croissant. While this was not the intended outcome, it was fun. I am not sure if the shapes actually "merged" together, and if I used the right command to do so, That is another aspect that I would like to take another look at.

<p align="center"> <img width="500" alt="Experimenting in the Workshop" src="assets/Accidental Croissant.png"></p> <br/> 


# Week 1: Introduction to the Maker Space #
## Week of 09/02/2024

This week, I wanted to become aquainted with the lasercutters and 3D printers available to me at Jacobs. I decided to alter a project I had worked on in the past, and make some wooden Dragonfly wing charms, for earings or a keychain. I made a mistake in my design, and accidentally cut off the rings, so I will alter the product to be a magnet, and I may in the future reattempt this design. I would also want to play around with different raster values, to have a cleaner look, and not have the wood look too singed.<br/>
I also participated in the Form 3, and the Objet Connex workshops, to aquaint myself with the other printers we have accesible to us.
