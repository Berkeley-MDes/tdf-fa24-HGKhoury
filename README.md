# Week 2: Becoming Better Aquainted with Grasshopper #
## Week of 09/09/2024

Over the weekend I tried to continue to go over the grasshopper tutorials, and was struggling a bit to understand how to read the files and create my own. I was able to play around with the sliders though, and that did help me understand a bit about how Grasshopper functioned (Images 2 and 3). <br/>

During the class on Monday though, I attened the Grasshopper workshop, and understood a lot more of the structure, and the software really clicked with me. Looking to the future, I know that I tend to learn better from in-person workshops and tutorials, so I will strive to attend any office hours and workshops that are available to me.   <br/>

After the workshop, I wanted to play around myself with creating shapes, and merging bodies together to create more complex shapes. Coming from a mechanical engineering background, where I am used to using SolidWorks, it has been a bit challenging to switch my thinking process around CAD from Solidworks to Rhino/Grasshopper. I wanted to test out creating an adjustable cloud shape. <br/>

 <p align="center"> <img width="400" alt="Experimenting in the Workshop" src="assets/Merge Testing.png"></p><br/>

I made this shape so that the radii of the cloud shperes could be changed, and therefore their placement relative to each other. However, while trying to create a shortcut to make a cloud shape, I accidentally created a croissant. While this was not the intended outcome, it was fun. I am not sure if the shapes actually "merged" together, and if I used the right command to do so, That is another aspect that I would like to take another look at.

# Week 1: Introduction to the Maker Space #
## Week of 09/02/2024

This week, I wanted to become aquainted with the lasercutters and 3D printers available to me at Jacobs. I decided to alter a project I had worked on in the past, and make some wooden Dragonfly wing charms, for earings or a keychain. I made a mistake in my design, and accidentally cut off the rings, so I will alter the product to be a magnet, and I may in the future reattempt this design. I would also want to play around with different raster values, to have a cleaner look, and not have the wood look too singed.<br/>
I also participated in the Form 3, and the Objet Connex workshops, to aquaint myself with the other printers we have accesible to us.
