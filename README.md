# Week 1: Introduction to the Maker Space #
## Week of 09/05/2024

This week, I wanted to become aquainted with the lasercutters and 3D printers available to me at Jacobs. I decided to alter a project I had worked on in the past, and make some wooden Dragonfly wing charms, for earings or a keychain. I made a mistake in my design, and accidentally cut off the rings, so I will alter the product to be a magnet, and I may in the future reattempt this design. 
I also participated in the Form 3, and the Objet Connex workshops, to aquaint myself with the other printers we have accesible to us.
