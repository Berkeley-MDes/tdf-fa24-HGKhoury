# Week 4: Analyzing my Device Ecosystem #
## Week of 09/26/2024

This week, in preparation for the second project, and for the homework, I brainstormed what devices and platforms I used on a regular basis, and due to the fact that I do not support the over complication of household processes and am careful to have to omuch of my data recorded, the only ecosystem that collects my data on a daily basis (that I am aware of and consent to) is my health and fitness tracking ecosystem. I created a concept maps of the different technologies and platforms that I use to collect and analyze my health and fitness data. <br/>

 Going in to the future, corporations will attempt to collect even more of users' personal data, for botht their own internal analysis to track the usage of their products to be able to make better products, as well as continuing to sell our data for additional profit. I think there is a serious conversation that we as designers using emerging technology need to have regarding the collection, storage, and usage of consumer data. As well as users, we need to discuss "Is convenience worth having our data being sold without our consent?" 

# Week 3: Working on Project 1 #
## Week of 09/09/2024

This week, I continued to work on my computational design project. I started by creating a customizable tear drop shape, then moved into creating a shape more similarly to a wing. I first started with ideation and sketches

 Then I started making some experiments.

  After sitting in for some of Cody's office hours in the makerspace, I decided to have both wings be placed in the grasshopper file, as well as all the additional componant, and have them set up so that the user can laser cut their pieces. <br/>

Having worked on this project very intensly the past week, I am quite proud of the progress that I made in a software that I had never used prior to this class. I hope i will be able to continue to develop my experience in Rhino and Grasshopper, and find more uses that are more applicable to my envisioned career path. 

# Week 2: Becoming Better Aquainted with Grasshopper #
## Week of 09/19/2024

Over the weekend I tried to continue to go over the grasshopper tutorials, and was struggling a bit to understand how to read the files and create my own. I was able to play around with the sliders though, and that did help me understand a bit about how Grasshopper functioned (Images 2 and 3). <br/>

During the class on Monday though, I attened the Grasshopper workshop, and understood a lot more of the structure, and the software really clicked with me. Looking to the future, I know that I tend to learn better from in-person workshops and tutorials, so I will strive to attend any office hours and workshops that are available to me.   <br/>

After the workshop, I wanted to play around myself with creating shapes, and merging bodies together to create more complex shapes. Coming from a mechanical engineering background, where I am used to using SolidWorks, it has been a bit challenging to switch my thinking process around CAD from Solidworks to Rhino/Grasshopper. I wanted to test out creating an adjustable cloud shape. <br/>

 <p align="center"> <img width="400" alt="Experimenting in the Workshop" src="assets/Merge Testing.png"></p><br/>

I made this shape so that the radii of the cloud shperes could be changed, and therefore their placement relative to each other. However, while trying to create a shortcut to make a cloud shape, I accidentally created a croissant. While this was not the intended outcome, it was fun. I am not sure if the shapes actually "merged" together, and if I used the right command to do so, That is another aspect that I would like to take another look at.

# Week 1: Introduction to the Maker Space #
## Week of 09/02/2024

This week, I wanted to become aquainted with the lasercutters and 3D printers available to me at Jacobs. I decided to alter a project I had worked on in the past, and make some wooden Dragonfly wing charms, for earings or a keychain. I made a mistake in my design, and accidentally cut off the rings, so I will alter the product to be a magnet, and I may in the future reattempt this design. I would also want to play around with different raster values, to have a cleaner look, and not have the wood look too singed.<br/>
I also participated in the Form 3, and the Objet Connex workshops, to aquaint myself with the other printers we have accesible to us.
